# golangphoenix-tests

A demo project for the Golang Phoenix meetup titled, "Unit Testing and Mocking" on March 27, 2019. [Link here](https://www.meetup.com/Golang-Phoenix/events/259534609/)

I've walked through a number of examples via comments throughout the code with the bulk of them existing in ./main_test.go.

Additionally, I've added a Makefile with some helpful commands, check them out!
